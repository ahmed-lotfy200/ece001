        <h2>WHAT IS BIG DATA ANALYTICS ?</h2>
        <p>Big Data generally refers to data that exceeds the typical storage, processing, and computing capacity of conventional databases and data analysis techniques. As a resource, Big Data requires tools and methods that can be applied to analyze and extract patterns from large-scale data.</p>
        <p>The analysis of structured data evolves due to the variety and velocity of the data manipulated. Therefore, it is no longer enough to analyze data and produce reports, the wide variety of data means that the systems in place must be capable of assisting in the analysis of data. The analysis consists of automatically determining, within a variety of rapidly changing data, the correlations between the data in order to help in the exploitation of it.</p>
        <p>Big Data Anlytics refers to the process of collecting, organizing, analyzing large data sets to discover different patterns and other useful information. Big data analytics is a set of technologies and techniques that require new forms of integration to disclose large hidden values from large datasets that are different from the usual ones, more complex, and of a large enormous scale. It mainly focuses on solving new problems or old problems in better and effective ways.</p>
        <h3>Types of Big Data Analytics</h3>
        <h4>Descriptive Analytics</h4>
        <p>It consists of asking the question: What is happening? It is a preliminary stage of data processing that creates a set of historical data. Data mining methods organize data and help uncover patterns that offer insight. Descriptive analytics provides future probabilities and trends and gives an idea about what might happen in the future.</p>
        <h4>Diagnostic Analytics</h4>
        <p>It consists of asking the question: Why did it happen? Diagnostic analytics looks for the root cause of a problem. It is used to determine why something happened. This type attempts to find and understand the causes of events and behaviors.</p>
        <h4>Predictive Analytics</h4>
        <p>It consists of asking the question: What is likely to happen? It uses past data in order to predict the future. It is all about forecasting. Predictive analytics uses many techniques like data mining and artificial intelligence to analyze current data and make scenarios of what might happen.</p>
        <h4>Prescriptive Analytics</h4>
        <p>It consists of asking the question: What should be done? It is dedicated to finding the right action to be taken. Descriptive analytics provides a historical data, and predictive analytics helps forecast what might happen. Prescriptive analytics uses these parameters to find the best solution.</p>
