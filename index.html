        <h2>Big Data</h2>
        <p>The digital data produced is partly the result of the use of devices connected to the Internet. Thus, smartphones, tablets and computers transmit data about their users. Connected smart objects convey information about consumer.s use of everyday objects.</p>
        <p>Apart from the connected devices, data come from a wide range of sources: demographic data, climate data, scientific and medical data, energy consumption data, etc. All these data provide information about the location of users of the devices, their travel, their interests, their consumption habits, their leisure activities, and their projects and so on. But also information on how the infrastructure, machinery and apparatus are used. With the ever-increasing number of Internet and mobile phone users, the volume of digital data is growing rapidly. Today we are living in an Informational Society and we are moving towards a Knowledge Based Society. In order to extract better knowledge we need a bigger amount of data. The Society of Information is a society where information plays a major role in the economical, cultural and political stage.</p>
